# shodan-search

A class made to interact with the Shodan API (https://developer.shodan.io/api)

#### So far, can interact with the api and filter by:
* port
* protocol
* city
* country

And you can interact with the api (just use the .api.someshodanmethod()) or make adaptations based on the necessities you have (like filter the results using another propery of the data returned by shodan).
